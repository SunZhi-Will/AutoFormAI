- A valid [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) API key

#### Running the Application
Simply download this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No server is required.

You can also use:
- Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" extension
- Any static file server (such as Python's `python -m http.server`)

### Option B: Python Version

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- A valid [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) API key

#### Setup
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   cd python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure the Python script:
   - Open `python/ai_form.py` in a text editor
   - Set your Google Form URL and personal information in the script
   - Create a `.env` file in the python directory with your API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ai_form.py
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Frontend Version

1. Enter your Gemini API key
2. Paste a Google Form URL
3. Wait for the form structure to be detected
4. Enter your personal information
5. Click "Generate Link" to get your pre-filled form URL

### Python Version

You can customize the script by modifying:
- The `URL` variable with your Google Form URL
- The `PROMPT_PARTS` list with your personal information

### Custom Information Format
You can format your personal information however you like. Example:
```
Name: John Doe
Gender: Male
Email: example@email.com
Birthdate: {"year": 1990, "month": 5, "day": 15}
Interests: Music, Hiking, Reading
```

## ⚠️ Notes
